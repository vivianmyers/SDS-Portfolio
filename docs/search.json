It contains data about institutions as a whole and data about certain fields of study within institutions. For this project, we will only be focusing on schools in the Massachusetts region.\nAccording to the Technical Documentation: College Scoreboard Institution-Level Data, data was collected from institutions’ federal reports, data on federal financial aid, and tax information. Only information about Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) institutions that participate in Title IV programs and IPEDS institutions that do not participate in Title IV but have similar criteria are included in this dataset.\nThis project aims to answer the following question: How is the cost of attendance affected by school type, admissions rate, and highest offered degree for Massachusetts (MA) colleges in 2021? We visualized admissions rate, school type, highest degree offered, and cost of attendance data for MA colleges."

    "text": "Paragraph 2\nFor the first plot, we visualized school type, cost of attendance, and admissions rate using a scatter plot. We can see that schools with admission rates below 0.25 tend to have costs of attendance that are higher than $60,000. This indicates that schools with low admissions rates tend to be more expensive than schools with high admissions rates. The color-coding of the data points allows us to realize that private nonprofit schools tend to be the most expensive.\nFor the second plot, we visualized the cost of attendance based on school type using a box plot. We can see how the median and range of cost compares to school type (private vs. public). In this plot, we can see the medians of each school type are 1) Private for-profit: ~$30,000 2) Private nonprofit: ~$55,000 and 3) Public: &lt;$20,000. This indicates a clear trend. Private institutions in MA are more expensive than public schools.\nFor the third plot, we visualized the relationship between highest degree type offered and cost. In this plot, we can see that public schools which only offer associate’s degrees are cheaper (~$10,000) than public schools which offer graduate level degrees(~$20,000). This indicates that schools with a higher degree level offered are more expensive."

    "text": "Blog post\nOur analysis mapped Honey Production in the USA (1998-2012). This dataset was produced by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. In 2006, concerns were raised about Colony Collapse disorder and the decline of honey bee populations in the US. Therefore, our question was: What is the relationship between states and honey production around 2006?\nVivian’s Map: The ‘Median Honey Production Revenue by State (2004-2008)’ map plots the revenue each state is making from honey. Median revenue was calculated as median numcol * median yieldpercol * median priceperlb over 2004-2008. North Dakota, South Dakota, California, and Florida had the highest median revenue over this time period. Some states, such as Oklahoma or Alaska, had no honey production data.\nHayden’s Map: The “Distribution of Number of Colonies by State” map visualizes the amount of colonies in each state relative to one another. From this map we can see that North Dakota and California have the most colonies at over 300,000 each. To plot these findings I used the numcol variable to produce a scaled diamond for each of the 41 states that had reported values. The remaining 9 states, such as Massachusetts and Oklahoma, had no reported findings which is highlighted by the lack of diamond.\nFrom our analysis, we were able to conclude that North Dakota is a top honey producer in the U.S. as it is a leading state in terms of number of colonies and revenue collected. Generally speaking, we observed a direct relationship between the number of colonies a state has and their overall gross revenue. When a state has a large number of colonies, they tend to also have a larger gross revenue. Another factor to consider is that each state has its own price per pound which could skew the amount of revenue they collect in relation to the amount of honey they produce. One ethical concern to consider is the missing data that this set contains. Since we don’t have any data for 9 of the 50 states in the U.S. this could’ve skewed the general findings that we came to."

    "text": "Blog Post\nParagraph 1:\nThis database contains public information about all official World Cube Association (WCA) competitions, members, and results. The database contains public information about all official WCA competitions, WCA members, and WCA competition results. This comprehensive dataset allows for exploration of performance trends and demographic patterns within the speedcubing community. In this analysis, we focus on the following question: What is the relationship between country and gender among the top global competitors? Combining summary statistics, tables, and visualizations, the analysis aims to uncover performance disparities and demographic imbalances across countries, offering a holistic view of global trends in elite speedcubing.\nParagraph 2:\nTable 1 describes the top 15 global competitors and related demographics. It contains their full names, country, gender, best time, and world rank. It was created by joining tables containing names and ranking information and aggregating/subsetting relevant data. This table reveals that only 1 of the top 15 global competitors is female (Qixian Cao (曹岂娴) from China). Additionally, it reveals that a majority (8/15) of top competitors are from China with 5/18 being from the USA.\nPlot 2 is a bar chart that displays the average best single time per country among the top 50 WCA competitors, with bars colored by gender ratio to reflect the male-to-female composition of each country’s top performers. The chart reveals that competitors from China have the fastest average best times. Additionally, the color gradient representing gender ratio draws attention to the stark gender imbalance across most countries, which emphasizes the male-dominated nature of the competition.\nParagraph 3:\nThe key takeaway from our analysis is the under-representation of females among the top global competitors. Another takeaway is the large representation of China among top competitors. One ethical concern is the privacy of the competitors. Revealing each competitor’s full name and country allows for potentially malicious use of data and privacy violations, especially for younger competitors.\nThe gender disparity among top performers suggests more outreach for underrepresented groups. Furthermore, the geographic concentration of top competitors in certain countries raises questions about access to resources and training opportunities in different regions."
